# End of studies project

> Specs doc

## Overview

The project is meant to make an app on smartphones to calculate math problems.

## Objectives

- Calculate some math problems

  > Calculation could be done with an image or based on voice (image recognition / voice recognition)

  - Basic math equations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
  - 1st degree equation
    - exact format like `ax + b = 0`
  - 2nd degree equation
    - exact format like `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

- All equations to be stored in a database

- _**MAYBE** show graphs!!_

## Technologies

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for android.

in case a server is needed, we could use nodejs, python or java could be used to implement a server.

## Deadline

The deadline is 1 month, due at the end of April.

## Perquisites

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/CnWyvgX9/end-of-studies-project) to track tasks and progress
- [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/tnGhyZYTnx33lEPcplZdNy/PFE---Design) to be made for the app
